A simple http/json wrapper around [jedi][].

**Note**: It is not ready yet.

## Why

It's only purpose for me is to integrate it with [YouCompleteMe][] allowing to
run [jedi][] under python3 and get python3 completions, so at the moment not
all the API It has been wrapped.

## Disclaimer

I'm not a python programmer but I'm using this to experiment with python a bit.
